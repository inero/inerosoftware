# Semantic UI, React, and TypeScript Examples

Several examples built with [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Each example was created with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) and [react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts) using the following command:

``` bash
create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

For local development, run `npm start` in the root directory of any of these examples, and it will automatically start a server, launch the example in your browser, and watch for any changes that you make to the code. The page will reload with your changes automatically!

## [Fixed Header/Footer Layout](https://inero.github.io/semantic-ui-react-typescript-examples/fixed-header-footer-layout/)

<img src="screenshots/fixed-header-footer-layout.png?raw=true" width="320">

Fixes a header to the top of the view port and a footer to the bottom, while the region in the middle can scroll. Semantic UI supports fixed menus on the top and bottom out of the box, but they require manually adding padding to the middle region to avoid overlap. By using [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) for layout instead, that extra padding is not required.
